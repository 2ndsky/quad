Additional design for the smartVISU. This is a working copy as long as the design is not stable. When it reaches the stable state, it will maybe be integrated into the smartVISU itself.

If you want to use the icon definition for the shutter shifter you have to add two new files in the icon `ws` folder. In order to do that just execute the two following commands in the smartvisu folder:

```bash
cp icons/ws/fts_window_2w.png icons/ws/fts_shutter_0.png
cp icons/ws/fts_window_2w.png icons/ws/fts_shutter_00.png
```

This is because of a known bug in the shutter shifter implementation of this design.
